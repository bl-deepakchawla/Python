Probability Theorem in python

# Bayes Theorem
Bayes’ theorem is a way to figure out conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event happening, given that it has some relationship to one or more other events. For example, your probability of getting a parking space is connected to the time of day you park, where you park, and what conventions are going on at any time. Bayes’ theorem is slightly more nuanced. In a nutshell, it gives you the actual probability of an event given information about tests.

# Central Limit Theorem
One	reason	the	normal	distribution	is	so	useful	is	the	central	limit	theorem,	which	says	(in essence)	that	a	random variable	defined	as	the	average	of	a	large	number	of	independent and	identically	distributed	random	variables	is	itself	approximately	normally	distributed.

# Normal Distribution
Normal Distributions are the most common distributions in statistics primarily because they describe a lot of natural phenomena. Normal distributions are also known as ‘Gaussian distributions’ or ‘bell curve’, because of the bell shaped curve.
